          HIMYM is easily my favorite show among them. I have no idea how someone can say it had a decent ending; I hate it. My advice to anyone who hasn't watched it is, "Do not watch the finale." Stop at the second to last episode.

        <AccordionTrigger>2. The Office</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          Another amazing show, The Office is absolutely mind-bogglingly beautiful, which makes it even sadder to see the fall off once Michael left. Jim & Pam has the be the best romantic story (friends to lovers trope) I have ever seen. It's kind of crazy how much Steve Carell carried the show oh yes and the infamous Creed Bratton.

        <AccordionTrigger>3. Two and a Half Men</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          This is the last sitcom I have seen. I loved watching it, Charlie Sheen was amazing his comedic timing is crazy. It's not like I hate Walden (Ashton Kutcher), but the quality drop was kind of insane, also Jake in the later years was not my favorite. I don't think they did a great job with his character development. Berta has to be one of the greatest characters ever.

        <AccordionTrigger>4. Brooklyn Nine-Nine</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          Brooklyn 99 has world-class writing. The episode "The Box" is my favourite Sitcom episode of all time, I remember watching it at 2 in the night, and it was crazy. Oh, and the Halloween Heists are world-class. I just didn't like that the Jake & Amy thing became the whole story, where every case solved and everything that happens is to develop their story. And those God-awful 'Black Lives Matter' episodes, I hate them so much.

        <AccordionTrigger>5. Parks and Recreation</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          I think even this is a perfect example of a good sitcom, there are so many good and like well-developed characters. I mean we could argue Leslie was the main protagonist but April & Andy's story, Chris & Ann, Tom's business story, Ron's fascinating stoic life and just sooo many good stories. It is like rock solid & it's a pretty good Must-watch.

        <AccordionTrigger>6. Modern Family</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          Another absolute banger of a sitcom. The craziest part about Modern Family is the sheer rewatchability of it, I could watch it a million times, like even its one of those shows whose YouTube compilations and reels you can watch again & again. I think the only arguement you could use against is they did not know how to write growing kids growing up like all cute kids and grew up and you either found them annoying or I just didn't like the way their Story panned out.

        <AccordionContent>
          I remember seeing New Girl in one of the most frustrating stage of my life & it is an amazing comfort show. Nick Miller has to be on peak of comfort characters, even the whole romantic plot with him and Jesse as frustrating as it was kept me hooked, even Coach I wish he was there longer but well the moment he was there was amazing.

        <AccordionTrigger>8. That '70s Show</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          Mediocre Sitcom like I don't think anything bad or great. Well, there are some good characters like Red and Kitty,I like the whole parenting eric done by red and kitty, good shit. The reputation of the show is beyond saving with so many mysoginistic remarks and comments and new shift about Mila to Kunts's age and accusations surrounding that Steven hyde's character, definitely not a show to watch with todays lens

        <AccordionContent>
          Super dry, awkward humor thats just a weird kinda humour i most of the time love RIcky Gervais Jokes but this time I have to admit not the biggest fan. Overall it’s clever and a nice change of pace if you like subtle comedy plus that's where I started watching Ricky Gervais' comedy and they are absoilutely peak.

        <AccordionTrigger>10. Friends</AccordionTrigger>
        <AccordionContent>
          Not my personal favorite, but it has a special place because it was the first sitcom I really got into. Nostalgia makes it fun to watch, and some moments still crack me up, even if it’s not the funniest show on this list. Ross's physical comedy has to be the greatest thing on the show.I think the thing about FRIENDS is the sheer amout pop culture assosiated with it, just crazy

        <AccordionContent>
          Has its moments, the sarcasm is top-tier, and Kat Dennings is just really fun to watch, The humor lands sometimes and during that its absoulutely hillarious but most of the times a lot of the jokes lean on stereotypes and can feel forced. Still, there are definitely episodes that are genuinely funny.

          Some genuinely reallyy nice moments Sheldon being Sheldon, Howard’s antics, the nerdy jokes. But overall it gets a bit repetitive and cliche.I don't particularly like Amy she just seems thoda sussy like it feels like they all treat sheldon as a child so the whole amy thing feels weird only .Fun at times, but mostly mediocre. Oh that Bernadette song I love it so much so cool
