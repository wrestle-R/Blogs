        <p class="mt-0">
          I'm a Computer Engineering student at Fr. CRCE, passionate about web development
          and building intuitive applications. Currently exploring AI/ML and IoT while
          working on various full-stack projects.

          When I'm not coding, you'll find me playing football (I'm the vice-captain of my
          college team!), strumming my guitar, or diving deep into music theory. I also have
          a soft spot for sitcomsâ€”check out my blog for my favorites.
        </p>
        <p>
          This blog is my digital diaryâ€”a place to pen down thoughts, reflections, and
          random musings before I forget them. It's not always serious, and sometimes it
          reads like I'm arguing with myself (and losing), but that's the fun of it.
