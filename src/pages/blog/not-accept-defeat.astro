        Yeaah, sooo we didn't qualify in the top 40 of our college's internal round. I was so disappointed hearing the result, I remember storming off while the speech was still on, like my own personal act of rebellion, and somehow the only thing in my mind was, "Ahh maybe I should have gone to the chapel in the morning."
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I was so furious at our judge; I remember calling him fat and bald, and some other words I don't wish to say. And then it hit me-

        Truth be told, I think I was always a little like that, during football matches I have blamed the referees, the opposition for having overage players, and sometimes even my own teammates.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        How can I be so full of myself that I never take responsibility for my failures?

        Lil Dramatic? maybe but it really did hit harder than I expected it to.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Anyways i think i can say lesson (hopefully) learned - maybe the world isn't conspiring against me next time. And maybe just maybe i should start taking responsibility for my actions.
