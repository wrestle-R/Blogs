        I have been thinking of starting a blog for a long time now, but then i didn't really have a good enough reason or motivation to start one. I came across this quote recently in a YouTube Short of all places actually:
      </p>
      
      <blockquote>
        "I think we forget things if we have no one to tell them to"
      </blockquote>
      
      <p>
        I think I have had a few good thoughts over the years and if i had penned them down, they'd have been nice reflections to look back on once in awhile.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Mehh I don't think I am serious enough person for my writings to be clear enough for many to relate or even understand, most of them will probably read like I was arguing with myself and losing, this is a place for some of my thoughts to be placed so incase i get hit in the head one too many times i wont forget
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Writing for people to read isn't the primary goal but entertaining people is always fun.
