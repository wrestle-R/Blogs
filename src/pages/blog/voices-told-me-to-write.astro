        I have been thinking of starting a blog for a long time now, but I didn't really have a good enough reason or motivation to start one. I came across this quote recently in a YouTube Short of all places:
      </p>

      <blockquote class="text-xl mx-auto text-center max-w-2xl px-4 py-3 rounded-md bg-muted-foreground/5 border border-border">
        "I think we forget things if we have no one to tell them to"
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        I think I have had a few good thoughts over the years and if I had penned them down, they'd have been nice reflections to look back on once in a while.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mehh — I don't think I'm a serious enough person for my writings to be clear enough for many to relate to or even understand. Most of them will probably sound like I was arguing with myself and losing. This is a place for some of my thoughts to be placed so in case I get hit in the head one too many times I won't forget.
      </p>

        A friend of mine brought up a TV show I used to follow religiously (Supernatural — 15 seasons, about 20 forty-minute episodes each). I finished it in under two months during the COVID lockdown. Not sure how good a defense that is, but I couldn't remember a single character's name afterward — suddenly it hit me: my memory's gone. THE INFAMOUS AGE is finally creeping up. Twenty now, forty tomorrow, sixty after... what's next, forgetting my face in the mirror? That actually doesn't sound so bad.

        I really hope this isn't one of those three-post blogs that doesn't get updated after the first month, but to be fair, far stranger things have happened.

        Writing for people to read isn't the primary goal, but if someone chuckles or relates to it, I call that a W.

        I think the most challenging part is not using emojis.
