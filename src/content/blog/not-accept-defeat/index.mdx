Yeaah, sooo we didn't qualify in the top 40 of our college's internal round. I was so disappointed hearing the result, I remember storming off while the speech was still on, like my own personal act of rebellion, and somehow the only thing in my mind was, "Ahh maybe I should have gone to the chapel in the morning."

I was so furious at our judge; I remember calling him fat and bald, and some other words I don't wish to say. And then it hit me-

"Am I so full of myself that I think the only way I could lose was if something went wrong or I was cheated?"

Truth be told, I think I was always a little like that, during football matches I have blamed the referees, the opposition for having overage players, and sometimes even my own teammates.

HOW CAN I BE SO FULL OF MYSELF THAT I NEVER TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY FAILURES?

lil Dramatic?  maybe but it really did hit harder than i expected it to 

Anyways i think i can say lesson(hopefully) maybe the world isnt conspiring agaisnt me next time, And maybe just maybe i should start taking responsibility for my actions,
