Yeaah, sooo we didn't qualify in the top 40 of our college's internal round. I was so disappointed hearing the result, I remember storming off while the speech was still on, like my own personal act of rebellion, and somehow the only thing in my mind was, "Ahh maybe I should have gone to the chapel in the morning."

I was so furious at our judge; I remember calling him fat and bald, and some other words I don't wish to say. And then it hit me—

> "Am I so full of myself that I think the only way I could lose was if something went wrong or I was cheated?"

Truth be told, I think I was always a little like that, during football matches I have blamed the referees, the opposition for having overage players, and sometimes even my own teammates.

<div style={{
  textTransform: 'uppercase',
  fontWeight: 'bold',
  fontSize: '1.125rem',
  letterSpacing: '0.05em',
  margin: '1rem 0',
  background: 'var(--muted)',
  textAlign: 'center',
  borderRadius: '0.5rem',
  padding: '0.75rem 1rem'
}}>
  How can I be so full of myself that I never take responsibility for my failures?
</div>

Lil Dramatic? maybe but it really did hit harder than I expected it to.

Anyways I think I can say lesson (hopefully) learned—maybe the world isn't conspiring against me next time. And maybe just maybe I should start taking responsibility for my actions.
