Yeaah, sooo we didn't qualify in the top 40 of our college's <a href="https://www.sih.gov.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={{ color: '#6876d2ff', textDecoration: 'none', fontWeight: '500' }}>SIH</a> internal round. I was so disappointed hearing the result, I remember storming off while the speech was still on, like my own personal act of rebellion, and somehow the only thing in my mind was, "Ahh maybe I should have gone to the chapel in the morning."

I was so furious at our judge; I remember calling him fat and bald, and some other words I don't wish to say. And then it hit me

> "Am I so full of myself that I think the only way I could lose was if something went wrong or I was cheated?"

Truth be told, I think I was always a little like that. During football matches I have blamed the referees, the opposition for having overage players, and sometimes even my own teammates.

<div style={{
  textTransform: 'uppercase',
  fontWeight: 'bold',
  fontSize: '1.125rem',
  letterSpacing: '0.05em',
  margin: '1.5rem 0',
  background: 'var(--muted)',
  textAlign: 'center',
  borderRadius: '0.5rem',
  padding: '0.75rem 1rem'
}}>
  How can I be so full of myself that I never take responsibility for my failures?
</div>

Dramatic? maybe just a little, but it really did hit harder than I expected it to.

## The Sunhack Experience

Even at <a href="https://sunhacks.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={{ color: '#6876d2ff', textDecoration: 'none', fontWeight: '500' }}>Sunhacks</a> 2.0 in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashik" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={{ color: '#6876d2ff', textDecoration: 'none', fontWeight: '500' }}>Nashik</a> I remember being so pissed at our judge, and honestly I feel it was thoda justified. Like every other team got three judging rounds and we got just one. We'd poured everything into that project, I slept a grand total of two hours in two days and the judge was literally on a call while checking our work. I mean, ffs man. 

Anyway, we didn't win but my friends did which was kinda nice(sort of a bittersweet thing). The campus was beautiful though, heard the faculty's trash so maybe it doesn't really matter.

<div style={{
  display: 'grid',
  gridTemplateColumns: 'repeat(2, 1fr)',
  gap: '1rem',
  margin: '1.5rem 0'
}}>

        objectFit: 'cover', 
        borderRadius: '0.5rem',
        display: 'block'
      }} 
      className="hidden md:block"
    />

## The Lesson??

Anyways, I think I can say lesson (hopefully) learned, maybe the world isn't conspiring against me next time. And maybe, just maybe, I should start taking responsibility for my actions.
