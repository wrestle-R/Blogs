I have been thinking of starting a blog for a long time now, but then i didn't really have a good enough reason or motivation to start one, I came across this quote recently in a Youtube Short of all places actually 

"I think we forget things if we have no one to tell them to"

I think I have had a few good thoughts over the years and if i had penned them down, they'd have been nice reflections to look back on once in awhile.

Mehh I don't think I am serious enough person for my writings to be clear enough for many to relate or even understand, most of them will probably read like I was arguing with myself and losing, this is a place for some of my thoughts to be placed so incase i get hit in the head one too many times i wont forget

Writing for people to read isn't the primary goal but entertaining people is always fun
