You know when you hear something and your first reaction is to laugh/chuckle, but then a second later you realize, "Wait, that's actually kinda messed up" and then you awkwardly try to unlaugh, like that can happen

Yeah, that's pretty much how my life has felt these past few weeks, it been a few trying weeks and its actually kinda funny how things can feel so normal in the moment but then when u take a step back you are like "woaahhh really"

Interestingly enough i somehow just know it will be alright, At the end of the day its night - Good Night.
