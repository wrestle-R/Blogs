You know when you hear something and your first reaction is to laugh/chuckle, but then a second later you realize, "Wait, that's actually kinda messed up" and then you awkwardly try to unlaugh, like that can happen.

Yeah, that's pretty much how my life has felt these past few weeks, it been a few trying weeks and its actually kinda funny how things can feel so normal in the moment but then when u take a step back you are like "woaahhh really"

So after either our MSE or ESE exams, me and my peeps usually go out, just to sorta chill, and mostly just hang out(talking about what happened each sem). Each time it's a slightly different vibe: one person more, one person less. Every time I leave, I think back to how different life felt during our last outing. It's funny how everyday life changes bit by bit, and then you turn around and realize everything's different.
